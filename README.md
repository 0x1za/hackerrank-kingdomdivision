The kingdom has a total of  cities numbered from  to .  The King wants to divide his kingdom between his two children, Reggie and Betty, by giving each of them  or more cities; however, they don't get along so he must divide the kingdom in such a way that they will not invade each other's cities. The first sibling will invade the second sibling's city if the second sibling has no other cities directly connected to it.
